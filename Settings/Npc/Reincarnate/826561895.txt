826561895	0	Jin	Wei	Born in Luoyang to a family of scholars, Jin Wei grew up studying the art of governance and war alike. When corruption rotted the empire from within, he abandoned the pen for the sword, vowing to carve justice through his own hands. Calm in speech yet fierce in conviction, Jin Wei is known for his strategic brilliance and his refusal to bow to power. On the battlefield, his mind cuts deeper than any blade—every strike calculated, every move a lesson in control. To his men, he is not just a commander, but the living proof that intellect and valor can share the same soul.	1	14	1	3	0	Item_BlackCloth	2	368107462	730066879	976607553				Experiences30							-902836903	1	2	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	Human	0	0		2
